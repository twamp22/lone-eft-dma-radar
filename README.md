## How do I start using this?
- After March 21st I will keep a compiled build updated via [Releases](https://github.com/Frostchi/eft-dma-radar/releases/tag/compiled) on this page. Download the release -> Unzip -> Run the .EXE -> Enjoy!

- Config folder location is now at `%AppData%\eft-dma-radar`. This fork will attempt to automatically import your existing config(s) from the Managed Lone Service.
